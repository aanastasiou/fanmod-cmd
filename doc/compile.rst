Compiling `fanmod-cmd`
=====================


Updating software
-----------------
`fanmod` relied on the `nauty` library which has moved on from the version initially used for `fanmod` (2.2). Updating to the 
latest (2.6 as of this writing) includes a streamlined process for compilation of `nauty` and finer control of its capabilities.
